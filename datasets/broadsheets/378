   Demonstrations by "Pegida," the German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamicization of the West, attracted protesters all over Germany on Monday. The historical landmark in western Germany, Cologne Cathedral, shut down its lights in a silent protest against the anti-Islamist demonstrations. (The Washington Post)   Anti-Islam demonstrations in cities across Germany have registered a growing number of supporters, but have also prompted a major backlash. The protests, organized by Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (Pegida) in opposition to the influx of Muslim immigrants in recent years, have been condemned by Chancellor Angela Merkel, Catholic organizations, and major celebrities and politicians. Here is a look at scenes from the demonstrations and the counter-demonstrations. Read: What’s behind the astonishing rise of an anti-Islam movement in Germany?
