Iraq's president has named deputy parliament speaker Haider al-Abadi as Nouri al-Maliki's replacement. Maliki, who served as head of the government for eight years, has resisted giving up his seat despite losing U.S. support.  The United States launched airstrikes Friday and continued its air campaign through the weekend. The military targeted key Islamic State positions over three days. The attacks helped Kurdish forces gain some momentum after they lost the Mosul dam and areas that were sanctuaries for Iraqi Christians. Yazidis are fleeing the mountain that many had been stranded on for days after their cities and towns were seized by Sunni militants.  Thousands of Yazidis fled Mount Sinjar from advancing Islamic State militants into Iraq’s northern Kurdistan region on Sunday, following U.S. airstrikes. Thousands of others are still stranded on the mountain. (Rudaw) The U.S. airstrikes reportedly allowed many members of the religious minority to flee. Thousands are still trapped on the mountain, "either because they are surrounded in their villages by militants with the Islamic State or are simply too weak to walk." Exodus.
