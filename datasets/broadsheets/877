 Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets in Hong Kong Monday to protest Beijing’s decision to reject open nomination calls for the election of Hong Kong’s chief executive in 2017. (Facebook: Nero Chan) The fourth day of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong happened to fall on the anniversary of the birth of a communist China. Still, demonstrations that have swelled in the region continued to remain peaceful, even as China continued with National Day celebrations. It wasn't all celebration for those who are a part of the movement. One protester expressed his displeasure when a helicopter carrying China's flag flew over Hong Kong. There was even heckling -- a Hong Kong leader received a negative response during a flag raising ceremony. Still, the peaceful protests continued in a movement that seems to be gaining traction daily. Here's a timelapse video showing the transformation of one of the main locations of the demonstrations: Umbrellas continue to be a big part of the story, and some even call this event the "Umbrella Revolution." Umbrellas are set up together, symbolizing the so-called 'umbrella revolution' of pro-democracy protests, next to the central government offices in Hong Kong on Oct. 1.
