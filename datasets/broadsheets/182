About 70 years ago, the Nobel committee was unable to recognize Mahatma Gandhi for his valiant and unprecedented nonviolence movement that led to an independent India. Today, Malala Yousafzai, a 17-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban and then promoted the importance of education, and Kailash Satyarthi, a proponent of Gandhi's teachings who used them to wage a protest against child labor, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The timing of the Nobel Peace Prize wasn't lost on many -- in recent days, India and Pakistan have once again renewed clashes in the border region. The forces of the universe are trying to give Pakistan and India a hint, hello, get the damn clue. #NobelPeacePrize — Imaan Sheikh (@SheikhImaan) October 10, 2014 As troops exchange fire, Indian & Pakistani win peace prize win for child rights. those know no geographical boundaries. #NobelPeacePrize — Maya Mirchandani (@maya206) October 10, 2014 #NobelPeace prize for Malala and Satyarthi signals push to end India, #Pakistan rivalry http://t.co/e59Vv2fVbj pic.twitter.com/ldOKlzslK2 — Hindustan Times (@htTweets) October 10, 2014 Ah, an allegory of the govt-people divide: Everyday people winning peace prizes while two exchange threats and mortar #NobelPeacePrize — Gibran Peshimam (@gibranp) October 10, 2014 In its statement, the Nobel Peace Prize committee specifically pointed out that a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, were joined in "a common struggle for education and against extremism."  Yet again, Nobel committee uses Peace Prize to make a political statement. http://t.co/JEBkexFchy via @scroll_in — naresh fernandes (@tajmahalfoxtrot) October 10, 2014 Making an Indian and Pakistani share the Peace prize is basically the Nobel committee going "HINT HINT GUYS." — Rega Jha (@RegaJha) October 10, 2014 India & Pakistan jointly share the Peace Prize. That speaks strongly for itself. Didn't need the Hindu-Muslim underlining in Nobel statement — barkha dutt (@BDUTT) October 10, 2014 "Nobel Committee regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani..." Why the religious, political tone? — Brahma Chellaney (@Chellaney) October 10, 2014 Still, there were some happy feelings out there. An #Indian and a #Pakistani share the #NobelPeacePrize! HOW AWESOME!! — Aseem Chhabra (@chhabs) October 10, 2014 Mahatma Gandhi never won the Nobel Peace Prize. But in a way, he did today. — Scott Simon (@nprscottsimon) October 10, 2014   RELATED: Nobel Peace Prize winners 1 of 13 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Nobel Peace Prize winners View Photos A look at the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize winners and other recipients throughout the years.
