 (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) The Senate's bombshell report shocked much of the world Tuesday, offering evidence of a paranoid and scared attitude that was apparently adopted by the United States in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. For a number of nations, the report was proof U.S. hypocrisy in that period and beyond. And for the nations famously named by President George W. Bush as the "Axis of Evil" in his State of the Union address in 2002, the report may seem like vindication. Iran, one of the three nations cited by Bush for their alleged desire to build "weapons of mass destruction," has been particularly vocal. The Twitter account of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lashed out at the U.S. on Wednesday: Any noble man would feel the sweat of shame about #GTMO; then-US.Pres. order on torture is shameful. #TortureReport #HumanRightsDay 1/3/08 — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 10, 2014 They claim #humanrights &trample its basics in their prisons,in interactions w nations &even w their own ppl.#TortureReport #Ferguson 2/8/10 — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 10, 2014 Brutality of corrupt capitalist regime isn't only limited to Afghanistan,Iraq&elsewhere but also it shows no mercy to its ppl.#TortureReport — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 10, 2014 Look at how humanity is being treated by dominant powers w flashy propaganda&in the name of #humanrights,democracy&freedom.#TortureReport — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 10, 2014 Today,US govt. is symbol of tyranny against humanity;even American ppl are faced w cruelty #ToutureReport #HumanRightsDay #Ferguson 7/28/07 — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 10, 2014 #TortureReport #Ferguson http://t.co/BMY29LXuGc pic.twitter.com/kR1J04Rk6B — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 10, 2014 In North Korea, another member of Bush's axis, a commentary on state news agency Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) criticized the campaign to get the United Nations Security Council to refer the North Korean leadership to the International Criminal Court. Instead, it pointed to the Senate's report and said that the U.S. should instead face investigation: Why the UNSC is turning its face from the inhuman torture practiced by the CIA over which the UN Anti-Torture Committee expressed particular concern and which is dealt with in the 6, 000 page-long report presented by the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Senate, and such despicable human rights abuses as white American policemen's brutalities of shooting and strangling black men to death. The final member of Bush's "Axis of Evil" was Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, but the former Iraqi president is no longer able to comment. Iraq was the only state mentioned in Bush's 2002 State of the Union speech to be targeted militarily by the U.S., with Hussein's regime destroyed after a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. As pointed out in one recent report from the Soufan Group, however, many senior members of Hussein's Baath party met with Islamist extremists in U.S.-run prisons after the regime fell. It's now believed that many of these former Hussein supporters went on to form the Islamic State, the extremist Islamist group that has left a trail of chaos in much of Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State is now the most feared of U.S. enemies. On Twitter, many supporters of the group have used the Senate report for a rallying cry against the U.S. and its allies. The "Axis of Evil" is just one small part of the chorus of international criticism for the U.S. following the release of the report: More ambiguous geopolitical rivals such as Russia and China have also been vocal in denouncing what they perceive as U.S. hypocrisy, and even firm allies are clearly uneasy with the report's findings. Ultimately, though, it may be tempting to dismiss criticisms of the "Axis of Evil" as self-serving (Iran and North Korea have made, at best, half-hearted attempts to reflect on their own wrongdoings), it's not hard to see a loss in moral standing for the U.S. since the invention of that loaded term.
