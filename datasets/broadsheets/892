 Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014 On Friday, the British government opened a new competition to redesign the one-pound coin. The new coin, announced earlier this year, will "world’s most secure circulating coin," according to a statement from the British Treasury, and the government wants the public to help design it. The hope is that the design will instill national pride. Not only will the coin have a unique 12-sided shape similar to the old British coin known as a “threepenny bit," the idea is that "its design will have a similarly British flavor, as budding designers are being asked to suggest designs that show what Britain, or ‘Britishness’ means, drawing on all of the qualities and quirks that make our nation unique." After British prime minister's office announced the news in a tweet with the hashtag #YourPoundCoin, the competition began – and all hell broke loose. Internet users created designs based on long forgotten children's television show characters and Web memes. One suggested design showed the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, grimacing, while another featured a man in a top hat doing some unsavory. One design stood out, however. Guido Fawkes, a right-wing political gossip blog, tweeted its proposal for a coin: RT @George_Osborne: I'm launching a competition today to design the new £1 coin. #yourpoundcoin pic.twitter.com/5Y9Hx2XX0c — Guido Fawkes (@GuidoFawkes) September 12, 2014 The image shows a perfect profile of Alex Salmond, the intractable Scottish Nationalist Party leader currently leading a campaign for Scottish independence that has the British government terrified. The design of the image is perfect: The profile image of Salmond looks perfectly in keeping with the picture of Queen Elizabeth II currently. In fact, the image dates back to April 1, 2014, and an article that appeared in the Daily Telegraph, "Alex Salmond to replace the Queen on new Scottish pound coin." The Telegraph article was an April Fool's joke, poking fun at Salmond's legendary ego. Now, half a year later, polls suggest that Salmond could actually win next week's Scottish independence referendum and break up Britain. And what's more, Scotland hopes to use the British pound if they gain independence, even if Westminster says no. Perhaps there really is no better symbol of Britishness, than the man who could break up the United Kingdom.
