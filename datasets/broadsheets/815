If Michel du Cille wasn’t shooting a photo, he was thinking of the next photo he was going to shoot. He had a head full of messages he wanted to convey from our two trips to Liberia, things he believed the people had to see, to understand. It was only a question of where and when he would find the perfect image to tell the story. [Read: Post photographer revealed dramatic world of human suffering, triumph] So he hated it when we had to be in an office somewhere, or cooling our heels interviewing officials for my stories. He knew our 12-day trips were too short to capture everything he needed to show. He wanted to be out there, walking around Monrovia’s crowded slums or bumping along Liberia’s terrible roads or inside hellish centers for the sick and the dead. He knew that the shot he wanted could be around the next bend or in the next corridor, and he couldn’t bear the idea that he might miss it. As far as I can tell, he never did. Du Cille died Thursday of an apparent heart attack while on assignment in Liberia. Here is a selection of some of his photos and videos on the Ebola crisis.
