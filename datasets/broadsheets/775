After months of Islamic militants carving out their own region in Iraq, the plight of the Yazidi sect in northern Iraq pushed the Obama administration to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State. The Yazidis were forced to flee their region after militants took to abducting and killing members of the religious minority. About 10,000 to 40,000 are stranded on Mount Sinjar relying on a small supply of food and water.

They are not dead, but we fear they are dying.”    (Ari Jala/Reuters)  At least 17 children have died so far.
