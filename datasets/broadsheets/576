 India's low-cost mission to Mars successfully entered the red planet's orbit Wednesday, crowning what Prime Minister Narendra Modi said was a "near impossible" push to complete the trip on its first attempt. (Reuters) Indians are celebrating what many countries have previously failed to do:  A spacecraft successfully completed the orbit of Mars, and did so in its first attempt. How big a deal is this? Not only is India the first Asian country to accomplish this feat, but out of the 51 attempts by other countries to orbit Mars, at least half have failed. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) even set up a Twitter account so Indians could follow along with the orbit.

Namaste, @MarsOrbiter! Congratulations to @ISRO and India's first interplanetary mission upon achieving Mars orbit. — Curiosity Rover (@MarsCuriosity) September 24, 2014 And fittingly, the Mars Orbiter sent a "Howdy" back. Howdy @MarsCuriosity ? Keep in touch. I'll be around. — ISRO's Mars Orbiter (@MarsOrbiter) September 24, 2014 Students in Ahmedabad, a city in Western India, took to the streets and set off fire crackers in celebrations.

(Amit Dave/Reuters) And many on social media were quick to note one remarkable fact about the orbit: the price tag. India's effort was 11 percent of the cost of the U.S. Mars probe called Maven, which entered Mars orbit on Sunday.
