Behind the 21 policemen in red caps that guarded his door, mourners had laid flowers and hung the flag of his native Colombia. The Nobel Prize-winning novelist had lived in Mexico City for years and wrote some of his most famous books here, including his 1967 classic, One Hundred Years of Solitude, which helped elevate Latin American literature onto the world stage. From his home, his ashes were driven north to the downtown palace for the afternoon ceremony. The president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, who described Garcia Marquez after his death as “the greatest Colombian who ever lived,” and the president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, both were expected to pay their respects at the palace, along with Garcia Marquez’ family, friends, fellow writers and admirers. His widow, Mercedes Barcha, and his two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo, were among the first to stand solemnly behind the urn under marble columns and the murals of Diego Rivera.

Organ grinders and guitar players tried to liven the mood.

I remember some scenes, like the rain of flowers, he was full of imagination.” “That’s precisely why I don’t write anything,” he said. “When I read his books I feel that I could never do such a thing like that.” Readers and leaders alike paid tribute at a Mexico City memorial to Nobel Laureate Garcia Marquez, who died last Thursday. Earlier, residents in his birthplace held a symbolic funeral. (Reuters)   Gutierrez had pinned a yellow ribbon to his black shirt in commemoration of the famous image and its author. There were hundreds, if not thousands of people ahead of him in line. He would be waiting for hours and felt lucky for the chance. “It’s amazing to see all the people here to say goodbye to one of the most amazing writers in Spanish.” 1 of 11 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tributes for Gabriel García Márquez View Photos The Colombian-born writer who lived in Mexico for decades and died there on April 17 is honored in Mexico City in a ceremony at the Palace of Fine Arts.
