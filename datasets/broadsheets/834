 Displaced Palestinians leave a U.N. school in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes. (Mohammed Abed/Agence France-Presse) Another cease-fire took effect between Israeli forces and Hamas in Gaza, allowing many residents to venture back to their homes. Many found their houses in ruins and tried to salvage any belongings that might have survived the fighting. Others took the time to search for any victims buried in the piles of rubble. Intense airstrikes and ground attacks have taken a huge toll on many towns in the region. Here is a look at Gaza almost a month after Israel began Operation Protective Edge. In beit hanoun.
