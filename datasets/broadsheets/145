Correspondent Simon Denyer is in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, where a group of separatists gathered in front of the state prosecutor's office and clashed with riot police. The scene unfolded quickly, with a crowd gathering around 7:30 a.m. and the doors of the office open about an hour later.  This post has been updated with a picture from inside the prosecutor's office after police left.
