LONDON -- Christianity is the largest religion in Birmingham so it came as a bit of a surprise to the locals when an expert on Fox News said that the city was off-limits to non-Muslims. Steve Emerson, who describes himself on his Web site as “one of the leading authorities on Islamic extremist networks, financing and operations,” was talking to Fox News in the wake of the terror attacks in France. "In Britain, it's not just no-go zones, there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don't go in," he told presenter Jeanine Pirro. According to the 2011 Census, 46 percent of Birmingham residents identify as Christian and 22 percent as Muslim. Birmingham is Britain’s second largest city, with a population of just over 1 million. Londoners were also taken aback by his comments about British capital. Emerson said that in areas of London -- he was hazy on where, exactly -- “there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire." You can check it out here: Cue much hilarity on Twitter. Not for nothing are the British famous for their sense of humor and many jumped on Twitter on Sunday night to ridicule Emerson’s claims using the hashtag #FoxNewsFacts. On Monday morning, it was still trending. Here's a roundup of some favorites: The city is now called Birming because Ham is not halal. Queen of England forced to convert to Islam.

Emerson has since apologized to the “beautiful” city of Birmingham and pledged a donation to the Birmingham Children’s Hospital. My comments on FoxNews about Birmingham were totally inaccurate. Birmingham, please accept my apology; I was wrong. Steve Emerson — InvestigativeProject (@TheIPT) January 12, 2015
