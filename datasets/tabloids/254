 Janice Dickinson is setting the record straight. The supermodel will appear on Sunday night’s episode of Botched, a new series on E! In it, she will strip down so her doctor, Dr. Terry Dubrow (of Real Housewives fame), can examine her “botched” breast implant procedure – from 30 years ago! But Dickinson told RadarOnline.com exclusively that the world will finally see who she really is.
