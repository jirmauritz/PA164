 Teresa and Joe Giudice celebrated their fifteen year wedding anniversary over the weekend, and the reality starlet posted a picture of the seemingly happy couple to social media. But the reality is practically the opposite. Sources tell RadarOnline.com that the couple had been arguing during the dinner, because Joe didn’t even want to go out to celebrate, and once at the restaurant, he was drinking heavily. “Joe thought it was ridiculous to go out, and Teresa wouldn’t stop nagging him about it,” an insider revealed. “He had completely forgotten about the anniversary, and could not have cared less about it.” PHOTOS: Punches!
