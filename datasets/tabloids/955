I want to be labeled a human who loves humans,” she said. “I’m tired of being labeled.” She then stated the same principle applies to her ethnicity. “I’m an American,” she said, “not an African-American. I don’t know where my roots go to, I don’t know what country in Africa I’m from. But I do know that my roots are in Louisiana.”
