 Teresa Giudice has had a tough time learning she can no longer afford to live a lavish lifestyle. Leading up to her sentencing date, Giudice had such dire money troubles that she had to borrow $50,000 from Just Desserts, as first reported, just to put gas in her car. Despite the family’s mounting legal bills and money problems, however, an insider tells that Giudice had no issue with blowing over $1,000 at a high-end boutique in New Jersey the day before her sentencing.

Now the 42-year-old reality star can’t just return her expensive coat and apply the money toward her bills, the source said however. “This is a boutique, so she would only get a credit,” says the source. “It’s not like Neiman Marcus, so she’s stuck with it.”
