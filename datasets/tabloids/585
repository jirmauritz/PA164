In 2010 when Lohan was scheduled to be in a Los Angeles court she claimed she lost her passport and as reported, begged friends to fly her home on a private jet, to no avail.  She was also reportedly photographed sitting next to a table with a white substance in lines on the table.

Everyone is worried that she’s back partying in Cannes and seeing the pictures of her in the club makes them think that she’s surrounding herself with her old friends and that her partying is out of control.” The source said Lohan paid for Doyle’s plane ticket to the international hot spot and friends are worried “he is enabling her and making a mess of everything.” PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Been In Rehab Fighting to stay clean, Lohan even has her brother, Michael Lohan Jr., on the trip with her. “Her brother is working his ass off to make things work for her and he is basically banging his head against a brick wall,” the source told. “This is so sad that Lindsay has these horrible people around her again.”
