 The hits keep on coming for the Church of Scientology. After a rocky year that saw Leah Remini leave the controversial organization, has learned that they could be about to lose yet another high-profile member. According to a source close to Tom Cruise’s camp, the actor and proud Scientologist’s son, Connor Cruise, has distanced himself from the church and begun exploring other spiritual paths. And he’s currently in the desert on a “spiritual quest” doing just that! “Connor is in Morocco right now doing some soul searching,” a source close the Cruise family tells exclusively. “He is on a spiritual journey.” On Monday, the aspiring DJ took to his Instagram account to post a photo of himself in Morocco, along with the caption “#Simplicity #Africa #Morocco #Kasbah.” Simplicity #Africa #Morocco #Kasbah A photo posted by Connor Cruise (@theconnorcruise) on Sep 15, 2014 at 3:39am PDT According to the insider, this trip is no simple vacation; but rather, it’s yet another sign that he could be leaving the Church Of Scientology for good. “Connor is no longer as interested in being a member of Scientology,” the source says. Reports about his allegedly growing disenchantment with the church first surfaced months ago: In an interview with Woman’s Day Australia, Cruise addressed the rumors that he had an estranged relationship with his mother, Nicole Kidman, who left the church after her divorce from Cruise.
