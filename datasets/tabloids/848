							Is Britney Spears a “Toxic” new addition to the lingerie industry? Less than a week after RadarOnline.com exclusively revealed that Beverly Hills boutique Addiction Nouvelle Lingerie accused the pop star of ripping off their designs, another intimates company is stepping forward with similar claims.
London-based lingerie brand Playful Promises posted a photo comparing the 32-year-old’s Intimate hangtags to their own well-established tags on their official Facebook page.

“Really worried that the new Britney Spears lingerie range’s branding might have copied our Playful Promises branding as it looks really similar to me!” they wrote on September 11, two days after the single mom’s Intimates line launched in the United States. (Playful Promises was established in 2004.)

The popular U.K. brand’s fans seemed to agree.
“Does look similar, but hers looks like a cheap copy!” said one.
“Well that’s just rude,” huffed another.
With it’s black corset design and cursive script, Spears’ logo also appears to be remarkably similar to Playful Promises’ logo.
 


Insiders tell Radar that Playful Promises has consulted lawyers, who said they could potentially make an action for copyright infringement of the artwork.
Not surprisingly, Spears has admitted to being heavily influenced by British lingerie brands.
“I’ve been to Europe and I went to London and I saw the most amazing lingerie store. I was like ‘I have to do something like this!’” the Las Vegas performer recently told Pop Sugar of her line’s inspiration.
