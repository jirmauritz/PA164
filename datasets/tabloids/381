 When Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé Knowles were both spotted leaving the same L.A. dermatologist on April 11, fans wondered if they’d finally bonded during a girls’ day out. But has exclusively learned that their run-in was actually a chance occurrence — and one it seemed that Knowles would rather have avoided! An eyewitness to the ladies’ awkward encounter at Dr. Howard Lancer’s Beverly Hills office tells Radar that when Kardashian arrived, she “seemed so excited to see Beyoncé and was really eagerly going over to her.” “But Beyoncé looked like she wanted nothing to do with Kim and was really trying to stay away from her,” the source says. “Kim was basically fawning all over her!” The two women did have a brief chat, with Blue Ivy’s mother asking about Kardashian’s daughter North West. According to the source, proud mama Kardashian gushed over the baby, saying, “It’s so good to be a mom and North is great and I love being with her. She’s just amazing.” PHOTOS: Kardashian’s Frozen Face Takes In The Sights In Vienna However, Kardashian’s attempt to bond over mommyhood was not exactly well-received. “Beyoncé looked like she couldn’t have cared less …,” the source continues. “It seemed so clear that she did not want to talk with Kim and was just being polite to her. They really didn’t look at all like friends.” Hollywood Plastic Surgeons Tell All: 42 Stars Who’ve Had Lipo, Face Lifts & Tummy Tucks Despite Kardashian and Knowles’ other halves, Kanye West and Jay Z, sharing a close personal and professional bond, their ladies don’t seem to be warming up to each other, as Radar has reported.
