 Looks like Chris Brown’s holiday weekend didn’t end so well. Though the singer spent July 4 partying with model girlfriend Karrueche Tran at 1OAK’s bash in Nobu Malibu, an insider exclusively tells that the pair split later in the weekend. “Karrueche and Chris are done,” the source says. “They’re not speaking.” PHOTOS: 27 Reality Stars Who Are Out Of Control And an Instagram photo may be to blame. On Friday, the 25-year-old— who was released from jail in early June after two months behind bars for violating probation— posted a very, very sexy black and white shot of Tran, 26, baring her butt in a tiny thong. He later deleted the revealing pic. “It seems she was upset by Chris’ photo,” the insider explains. But the model didn’t spend the rest of her weekend home in tears. On July 6, Tran shared some quality girl time with best friend Christina Milian, 32, at the Kia Motors Malibu Estate. And she didn’t want any reminders of her recent ex. “She didn’t want to listen to any Chris Brown music,” a source tells. PHOTOS: Secrets Of The Hottest Celebrity Splits!

She also deleted all photos of Brown from her account. In turn, Brown’s Instagram no longer includes photos of Tran. PHOTOS: Don’t Get Mad, Get Everything!
