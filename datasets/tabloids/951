 The woman brave enough to date O.J. Simpson for 13 year after he was acquitted of two brutal murders says her own time in prison has given her empathy for the disgraced football star. And in an exclusive interview, she tells that she still carries a torch! Christie Prody spent much of the last year behind bars for stealing painkillers from a home where she was working as a nurse assistant.

I was with a lot of really bad people, including several cellmates serving time for murder. I was afraid that I might be killed.” Fear of being killed is apparently not a new feeling for Prody, who claimed before going to prison that Simpson would make threats like, “You better watch out so something bad doesn’t happen to you like Nicole.” Simpson was found not guilty of the murder of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in 1994. But he’s serving a 33-year prison sentence for robbery in Nevada. PHOTOS: Crimes Of Passion Prody was 21 when she started dating Simpson, who was then 46. Thirteen years later, she’s still not over him. “I will always love him.” she told Radar. “He’s had a lasting effect on my life.” Prody pleaded guilty in 2013 to a second-degree burglary charge. A surveillance camera caught her stealing prescription medicines from a family’s home where she was employed as a nursing assistant.
