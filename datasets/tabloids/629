Vicki Gunvalson is finally able to close the door on one bad relationship, but RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that it cost her a pretty penny.
The Real Housewives of Orange County star has officially ended her marriage to Donn Gunvalson with a huge financial reward, and the savvy business woman is not happy about paying him off.
“Vicki is finally free with no chance of Donn coming back and wanting more money,” a source close to the situation told Radar.

“She had final meeting with her ex-husband over the weekend to have him sign a confidentiality agreement and she paid him his last check that was his settlement.”
The source said there was no way for the financially independent woman to avoid giving Donn cash.
“She had to pay him,” they told Radar.

Viewers met Donn in the beginning seasons of the RHOC when they were happily married and he was a regular fixture on the hit Bravo show, but their bitter breakup also became a storyline as their marriage crumbled.
The source pointed out Donn’s hypocrisy about the money he fought to make Vicki give to him.
“The oddity is Vicki’s husband hated the show and made remarks how stupid the show was, but he received a financial reward that she earned for all the years working on a show he thought was stupid.”

Vicki’s love life has been a central theme on the RHOC, with her years-long relationship with Brooks Ayers shown, but her new possible romance with attorney John Pankauski not making the cut for the season that is airing now.
Despite Donn’s denigrations of the show, the source told Radar that Vicki’s ex didn’t turn the money down.
“If I had to guess, I would say he will cash the check though,” the source added.
