							Keeping the Kardashian curves in check can take serious commitment, as Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney have proved over the years. Now, RadarOnline.com has learned, younger half-sister Kylie Jenner has turned to drastic measures to keep up with her skinny model sis Kendall: According to an insider, Kylie is a new devotee of the popular “Teatox Diet,” as “She is feeling the pressure to be perfect now more than ever.”
On Oct. 31, Jenner posted a photo on her Instagram  with the caption, “Happy Halloween.”
What the 17-year-old star of Keeping up with the Kardashians failed to crop-out, was the bright pink bottle of Lyfe Tea  in the background, otherwise known as the ‘Skinny Teatox Detox Diet”, which was previously used by her model sister, Kendall.

“I usually start my day off with a cup of detox tea,” 18-year-old Kendall told E! in Sept.
“I have like 12 cups a day,” she said, despite the company recommending only one cup a day.
As Radar previously reported, the younger Jenner sister is having a tough time “living in the shadows” of her older sister’s incredibly successful modeling career.
