 Not everyone is gung-ho about Britney Spears and TV producer Charlie Ebersol’s new romance. Ebersol’s mother, Kate And Ally star Susan Saint James, “cannot believe that her son is getting serious with Britney,” a source close to the 68-year-old actress tells exclusively. According to the insider, Saint James and Ebersol’s father, NBC executive Dick Ebersol, 67, have already met the “Toxic” singer. PHOTOS: You Better Work B*tch! Britney Spears Spotted Looking Happy And Healthy With Bodyguard Post Split With David Lucado “Charlie introduced Britney to the both of them as his girlfriend,” the source says. “But they do not agree about her.” “Dick thinks it is great to see his son happy, but Susan wants him to be with someone not famous.” According to the insider, Saint. James doesn’t believe that the rehab alum, who infamously suffered a nervous breakdown in 2007, is a suitable wife for her son.

Fortunately, Spears’ two children, Sean Preston, 9, and Jayden, 8, are fans of the new romance, as Spears took to her Instagram just two days before her 33rd birthday to share yet another photo of Ebersol and her kids playing on the beach together. “So grateful for family time this weekend. ❤ my boys!” she wrote.
