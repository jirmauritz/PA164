 Desperate times call for desperate measures? As Jodi Arias’ appeal continues to drag on, has learned that her mom and dad have taken to the internet, begging for fans to donate funds to help them overturn what they say is their daughter’s “wrongful conviction” in the brutal murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. The Arias family’s official Twitter account posted a link this week to a YouTube video titled “A Message From Bill and Sandy Arias.” “There are other websites soliciting donations for Jodi Arias’s appeal,” father Bill Arias says in the video. “We caution everyone against donating to these sites because we don’t know whether or not these donations will ever reach Jodi Arias.” PHOTOS: Serial Killers In A Skirt — 30 Cold Blooded Murderers Who Are Women The money will help “obtain the best legal representation” for Arias, mother Sandy Arias claims. “We love our daughter,” her mother says. “We support her and we stand behind her.” WATCH Their Jaw-Dropping Plea The two-minute video was shot in the parent’s Yreka, California, home in September, according to its introduction.
