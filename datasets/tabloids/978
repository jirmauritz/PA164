 Will former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Taylor Armstrong finally get her fairy tale ending? The Oklahoma native will marry Colorado lawyer, John Bluher this weekend in Southern California, is exclusively reporting. “Taylor and John will be getting married this weekend,” a source told. “Taylor has invited several of her former Beverly Hills housewives co-stars, [and] the couple has hired celebrity wedding planner David Tutera​ to assist with the big day.” PHOTOS: 12 Biggest Bravo Reality Star Weddings & Engagements Of 2013 In 2011, Taylor showed her troubled family life with her late husband — and the father of her daughter Kennedy — Russell Armstrong; who killed himself shortly after she filed for divorce from him, claiming he’d abused her. In 2012, Taylor made a fresh start with attorney John. She accepted his marriage proposal last year, and although they haven’t wed yet, on Thursday’s Couples Therapy finale on VH1, John said he wants to be Kennedy’s legal father, and planned to adopt her.
