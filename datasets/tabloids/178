 Tila Tequila‘s baby daddy is backtracking from the praise he gave her last week. After confirming the former reality TV star is pregnant with his baby, Thomas Paxton Whitaker exclusively told  she would be a great mother, but now the Georgia-native is telling they aren’t even in a relationship together and he feels like she took advantage of him. “Even though I had nothing negative to say about Tila in my comment to you, and the two of us are soon to share a child with one another, Tila and I are not together as a couple and we are no longer pursuing a relationship with each other,” Whitaker told.

I doubt she would ever get a drop of news coverage again for the rest of her days, but then Hollywood is a lot about deception and manipulation…isn’t it?” Whitaker, 42, alluded to trouble in paradise on his Twitter page last October when he tweeted: https://twitter.com/rook012tpw/status/389770228734767104 And when news broke that he was the father of Tila’s child, he cryptically tweeted: https://twitter.com/rook012tpw/status/459111646217383936 Tila has remained mum about her baby daddy, but continues to post things about her baby and claims to be super excited and happy: https://twitter.com/BabyMamaTila/status/459600608853368832 So it looks like Tila is going to be a single mother — how do you think she’ll handle it?
