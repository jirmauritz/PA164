 Robert Downey Jr. is desperately trying to woo Jack Nicholson out of retirement for a role in his upcoming movie Sherlock Holmes 3, RadarOnline.com has learned. “Bob’s determined to be the one to bring back Jack!” a source revealed, adding that Downey will even lower his own salary to lure Nicholson with big bucks. Nicholson, 77, has spent most of his time on the golf course after deciding to retire last year, as exclusively reported.

And it’s not the first time, as Downey, 49, tried to get the movie legend to play the role of his father in The Judge. However, Robert Duvall ultimately appeared in the film that will be released this fall.

But in 2010, he appeared in the Reese Witherspoon box office flop How Do You Know. After that, sources told Radar that Nicholson stepped away from acting because he could no longer remember his lines. Still, the One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest Oscar winner DOES recall how much money he used to rake in as one of Hollywood’s most popular actors.
