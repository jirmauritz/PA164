 Chill out Khloe! The youngest Kardashian sister is surrounded by the patter of little feet and the reality star is having a rough time dealing with the fact that she is still not a mom but her own mother has told her to “wait her turn,” RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned. Khloe’s fertility struggles with Lamar Odom were shown on the family reality shows, and she’s never been shy about hiding her desire to have children.

But instead of rushing into motherhood with her new beau, bad boy rapper French Montana, Khloe’s momager Kris Jenner is warning her about taking things too quickly.

So Khloe doesn’t need to freak out, she’s young!” And even though Kourtney is expecting her third child with Scott Disick, Kris reminded Khloe that she waited too.

And the longer she waits the more afraid she is that her time is slipping away.”
