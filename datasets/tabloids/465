 Skinnygirl in the city? Not a chance. has learned that Bravo exec Andy Cohen recently asked Bethenny Frankel to return to the ratings-challenged Real Housewives of New York. But despite the fact that he was the one who gave Frankel her big break years ago, a source says she turned him down flat! Even though Cohen is no longer an executive at Bravo, “honchos at the network asked him to reach out to Bethenny and ask her if she would be open to making a return to RHONY,” an insider tells. “The hope was she would come back as a regular cast member, but Bethenny was also offered a guest role. Andy no longer has the power to hire or fire anyone at Bravo, since he lost his executive job, but the bosses knew how much Bethenny respects and likes him” and thought he could convince her. Unfortunately for Bravo, “Bethenny didn’t even take time to think it over [before saying] no ,” the source reveals. “She has absolutely no plans at this time to return to reality television. She believes she has moved on from that.” PHOTOS: The Ring Is Off!

Recently, Frankel likened memories of her experience on RHONY to “flashbacks from Vietnam” during an appearance at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center’s Seasons of Health event. “I failed as a talk show host,” Frankel told the crowd.

The show would tremendously benefit from having her back.” PHOTOS: Bethenny Frankel Sizzles In Miami!
