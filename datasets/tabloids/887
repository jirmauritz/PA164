 Teen Mom 2 baby daddy Adam Lind, speaking exclusively with RadarOnline.com, vigorously denied claims from former girlfriend Jessica Nicole that he was physically abusive with her in fits she attributed to steroid-fueled rage. As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Nicole, a single mom from South Dakota, posted a number of photos on Instagram that painted Lind in an awful light, showing him injecting himself with a hypodermic needle; bottles with steroid labels; and red marks on her arms she attributed to his rough handling of her. (She added, “Karma is really a b*tch.”) The 23-year-old Lind, however, said that Nicole’s allegations are “all lies,” fueled by her thirst to “get back in the spotlight.” PHOTOS: Teen Moms With Tats!
