 Charlie Sheen was not up to one of his wild antics during his recent dentist visit, a publicist for the star exclusively tells RadarOnline.com. Though online reports claim the actor, 49, pulled a knife on a dental technician while under the influence of rock cocaine last Thursday in Los Angeles, Jeff Ballard insists there was no weapon present at the routine appointment. “There was no knife and no one inside Charlie’s camp has heard from the LAPD,” Ballard tells Radar.
