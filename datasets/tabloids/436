 Teen Mom 2’s Adam Lind is quite familiar with volatile relationships — and jail. RadarOnline.com can exclusively report that the father of MTV reality star Chelsea Houska’s daughter Aubree, 5, was thrown behind bars at the Minnehaha County Jail in his native South Dakota last night at 8 PM on domestic stalking charges with no bond. A jail spokeswoman tells Radar that Lind, 25, is expected to appear in court this afternoon.

As Radar exclusively reported, Lind was last jailed in September for driving with a revoked license. He was also been found guilty of three DUIs, and is still facing misdemeanor charges stemming from a fiery car crash last winter. Beaton, a mother of two, was busted in 2009 for embezzlement involving grand theft, and was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia the following year.
