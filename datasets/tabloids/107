“Ross’ show was canceled as part of the fallout with Chelsea Handler,” the insider revealed.
“She’s the one who championed his show to go to air and produced it, so since she’s not renewing her contract with the network, E! is cutting all ties.”
According to the industry insider, all staff and crew on Hello Ross was told the show is ending on Monday and their last day will be Wednesday.
