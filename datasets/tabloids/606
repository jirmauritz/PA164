 Joe Giudice is demanding Bravo pay him $30,000 to appear on the Real Housewives Of New Jersey reunion shows, is exclusively reporting. Joe and his wife Teresa are expected to be sentenced in connection with their bankruptcy and fraud case on October 2, with the reunion taping just three days later. But now, according to a source, Joe is trying to negotiate a deal around his potential sentencing that would force Bravo to pay him 30 Gs! Joe is “hopeful that he wouldn’t be remanded into custody on October 2, and will be given a date to turn himself in at a later time. After the Christmas holidays would be ideal. “But being fully aware that Bravo needs both he and Teresa to appear on the reunion, Joe is demanding that he get $30,000,” the source told. And Joe has decided, “If Bravo doesn’t want to pay him as much, he just won’t be there,” the source claimed.

The plan was shot when Teresa was told that Bravo’s Andy Cohen would be doing the first post-sentencing interview because she is contractually obligated to do it with him. So she’ll miss out on a potentially big paycheck, the source said.

Teresa could be sentenced up to 27 months in prison, with husband Joe facing 47 months behind bars.
