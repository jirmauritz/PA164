 In a preview for the upcoming episode of Jersey Belle, star Jaime Primak Sullivan headed to the tattoo parlor to get some special ink in the shape of the state of New Jersey on her arm. While she was getting her tattoo, some of her friends disapproved of her choice — but they were in for an even bigger shocker. “I think it’s time to stick the needle in just a little bit further,” Sullivan told the cameras, in an exclusive sneak peek on RadarOnline.com.

Jersey Belle airs on Bravo Monday nights at 10:00 p.m. ET.
