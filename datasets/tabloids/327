 There are some advertising dollars Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott‘s reality TV show just don’t want — and a website promoting extramarital affairs is one of them, has exclusively learned. Even though the couple is airing their dirty laundry on a Lifetime docu-series True Tori for all to see, the network behind the show rejected a commercial from Ashley Madison. According to a spokesperson, AshleyMadison.com founder Noel Biderman is “fuming” over the rejection.
