							Brandi Glanville  just can’t win. Only weeks after fans slammed the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star for joking about her “a**hole” son on air, the reality TV mom is under fire yet again after tweeting a pic of her sons in their underwear. After fans ripped her apart for the “nasty” pic, Glanville of course came back swinging — and RadarOnline.com has all the details.
The latest mama drama started innocently enough, when Glanville posted this photo of her sons with Eddie Cibrian, Jake, 7, and Mason, 11, building a desk.
Proud mom Glanville wrote, “My little helpers are trying to build Jake’s desk!”

But Twitter critics were quick to pounce calling the pic “inappropriate” and slamming her parenting skills.
“Sorry … it’s not appropriate to post pics of kids only in their underwear,” @Marissa_saysso wrote.
User @JosephVLopez agreed, “It’s very inappropriate!”
And @SusanSavoieRich wrote, “I too don’t think it’s appropriate to post your kids in their underpants on Twitter … just sayin!!”
