 Kenya Moore likes people to believe that she has a wealthy boyfriend and is living in the lap of luxury but has exclusively learned that she is in dire financial straits and most of her expensive things didn’t really belong to her. The Real Housewives of Atlanta star has come under fire for not revealing who her “rich African boyfriend” is and often insinuates that he is paying her bills but a source close to the situation revealed that she isn’t telling the truth. “Kenya is basically broke and she doesn’t have any money,” a source close to the Bravo star told.

The 23 Highest-Paid Reality TV Stars “Most of the things that she shows off, like purses or cars, don’t belong to her.” Keeping up with the likes of NeNe Leakes is always part of RHOA, with the women trying to one up each other with their high-priced accessories, but the source said Moore isn’t as well off as she wanted the viewers to believe. “Kenya  had a local car dealership in Atlanta give her a really expensive car on loan and then they got the publicity that she was driving a car from their lot.  It was just during filming and it was a good deal for both of them. She was able to pretend she had a high end car and they got the free press.” Faked Scenes, Lies & Payoffs – The Ultimate Guide To Reality TV Shows The source also said the former Miss USA, who is competing on Donald Trump’s Celebrity Apprentice, was always getting involved in business deals that fell through. “Kenya previously turned down money-making TV appearances and she had a movie she was going to do overseas but it never happened. So when Celebrity Apprentice came up she had to say ‘yes.’  She desperately needs the money and the longer you stay on the show the more you get paid.” Dismissing Moore’s claims that she’s being supported by a boyfriend, the source told that was highly unlikely.
