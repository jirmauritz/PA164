 For Pauly D, poppin’ bottles has a whole new meaning these days. Eleven months after his daughter Amabella was born, has learned that the Jersey Shore star has made fatherhood a priority, and has worked out a temporary custody agreement with his baby mama so he can regularly see his daughter. “Although Pauly and Amanda are still at odds over custody, he has finally been able to get visitation with his little girl,” a close pal exclusively told. The reality TV star (real name: Paul DelVecchio) confirmed last October that he had fathered Amabella with former Las Vegas fling, Amanda Markert. PHOTOS: She’s Already Fist Pumping!

She smiles all the time. Always smiling. I always smile, too, so she’s definitely my baby just by that big smile she has,” the proud papa gushed.
