It’s embarrassing for her. That is the reason why Kris wasn’t there.” As has reported, Bruce’s sons Brody and Brandon believe their dad could be transitioning to a woman. An insider told, “Brody and Brandon love their dad, and if Bruce did finally admit that he was transitioning and becoming a woman, it wouldn’t change how they felt about him. They are both very open supporters of the LGBT community.” Do you think Kris should support Bruce’s style choices? Let us know in the comments!
