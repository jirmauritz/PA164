Fox’s acting career really took off in 2007 after starring in Transformers with Shia LaBeouf, and transform she has!
“Megan appears to have had some cosmetic procedures to her face. While she has probably not had anything major, I suspect that she has had a nose refinement and some facial fillers,” Dr. Matthew Schulman — who has never treated Fox, 28 — told Radar.
