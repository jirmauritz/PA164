 Michael Jace is behind bars after being charged with murder in the shooting of his wife Monday in Los Angeles, and as reports continue to surface as to what could have motivated her violent death, RadarOnline.com has learned that the actor was facing some severe money troubles since filing for bankruptcy. According to documents obtained by Radar Online, Jace has been $500,000 to $1 million in debt since declaring Chapter 13 in 2011. In fact, his financial burdens became so heavy that he was behind $2,886 as of October 16, 2013 on his monthly $962 payments, with the trustee even going so far as to file court documents to dismiss the case due to the delinquent payments – the motion was then withdrawn two months later. Read The Documents Jace, best known for his work as a closeted cop on The Shield, listed his total assets at $325,500 and his liabilities as $514,761.03. As part of the monies he owed included back taxes of $22,276.03. At that time he had also defaulted $40,006.79 on their home.
