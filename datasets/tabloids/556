Having her here is a complete nuisance. She’s going to bring paparazzi and disturb the peace the neighborhood,” the source told Radar.

He probably doesn’t have enough money for her.” And a more worrisome complaint leveled by the neighbors?  They say Montana doesn’t take good care of his dog! “French’s dog is always outside wildly barking.  I don’t think he spends any time there at all and the dog is out of control.”
