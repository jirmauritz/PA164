 Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick could be done for good this time. After RadarOnline.com exclusively reported that Kardashian left him over his heavy partying, Disick took to Instagram today to joke about drug use and insist he just doesn’t “give a f*ck!” “Just stop right there, I already don’t give a f*ck,” Disick, 31, posted on his Instagram Wednesday afternoon, amid a flurry of new reports that he was dumped by Kardashian, who is 9-months pregnant with the couple’s 3rd child, a boy. But that’s not all. Earlier, rehab vet Disick showed that he might not be taking his recovery very seriously by posting a photo of a dog with white powder on its nose, along with a caption that reads, “I guess this little guy started young.” Fans called him out for the apparent reference to drug use, hash tagging the pic “#coco,” slang for cocaine, in the comments. Disick entered rehab following his hospitalization over the summer for alcohol poisoning, but left before completing treatment.
