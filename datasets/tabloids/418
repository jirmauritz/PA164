 The same day that Robin Williams’ assistant Rebecca Erwin Spencer, discovered his tragic death scene, her husband, Dan Spencer, spoke out about the couple’s relationship with the tortured star, has learned, and the pain he suffered in his “final fight.” In a revealing and heart-rending tribute posted on Facebook, Spencer has broken his silence and shed light on the “war” that drove his “hero” to suicide. PHOTOS: The Woman Who Discovered Robin Williams’ Body “As a little boy, he was alone in his room with his toy soldiers while his parents went off on business trips,” Spencer wrote. “You can imagine his mother and father telling him to be a good little soldier while they were away. Then he would be left alone to play with his friends, which were little Army men. When his parents returned, he received a gift, a token for his good behavior, maybe more little soldiers to add to his collection.” “Those toys remained with him throughout his life and were often given prominent space in his home on specially crafted display cases,” he continued. “He discovered video games, first-person shooters for computer and then for Xbox. Name a game, no matter how obscure, and he owned it. He played his soldier games even up to age 62. We had an expression for his avid gaming. We said he was in there ‘saving the world.’” PHOTOS: Robin Williams’ Hollywood Peers Remember The Late, Great Star Of Film & TV Referencing his many USO tours, Spencer remembered, “Then he went off to dangerous places like Afghanistan and Iraq at the height of war to entertain the troops, the soldiers. Maybe it was a way to pay back his boyhood friends. Those of us lucky enough to be in his sphere saw our hero conquer the world. We joined him on journeys across the globe. He killed ‘em! He slayed ‘em! What great victories! What wondrous experiences! We were incredibly fortunate to follow him into the breach. With laughter, love, and kindness, he did it! He saved the world!” “In his advancing years, our hero found a new love who we knew would march with him to the end of the rainbow,” Spencer said, perhaps referring to Williams’ wife of nearly three years, Susan Schneider. “After decades of battles, a happy ending was in sight.” “But his final conflict was heartbreaking to witness,” Spencer continued. “Oh, if you could only have seen the war raging inside him. It would have stopped your heart. We fought the fight with him, but it left him defeated.” PHOTOS: Inside The Waterfront Home Where Robin Williams Tragically Died “Now our hero has laid down his arms. He has bid his soldiers farewell. The final fight is over,” Spencer wrote. “At last, that lonely little boy is at peace.” As reported, Spencer’s wife Rebecca was the one who found Williams dead on Monday afternoon in his Tiburon, Calif., home, with a belt around his neck and “superficial” cuts on his left wrist.
