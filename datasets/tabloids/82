 Though RadarOnline.com recently exposed her botched readings, tour tricks and diva antics in bombshell reports, Long Island Medium star Theresa Caputo insisted she’s remained cool, calm and collected. “I don’t let negativity and negative people affect me and neither should any of you!” she huffed on her Facebook page in June. “Don’t react, take a deep breath and let it go.” But it seems the self-professed medium, 46, wasn’t quite telling the truth. In her new book You Can’t Make This Stuff Up, Caputo confesses she recently experienced a terrifying anxiety attack while visiting her acupuncturist.

I’m freaking out! Please don’t leave the room. Just stay with me,’” the mother of two recalls. PHOTOS: Faked Scenes, Lies And Payoffs!

As Radar exclusively reported, ticket sales for her latest tour have been in a slump, with 1,000 of 2,455 seats still available for her October 13 performance in Charlotte, North Carolina. “I think fans are catching on to all her tricks,” an insider close to Caputo tells Radar. “Her popularity won’t last much longer, and she knows it.”
