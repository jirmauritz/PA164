 As news broke Friday that former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Dana Wilkey recently had been arrested on fraud charges, Wilkey was in the happiest place on Earth — literally. Instead of hiding out, she spent the day at a Disney theme park, and has all the details. As Radar reported Friday, Wilkey is heading down a similar road to fellow Housewife Teresa Giudice thanks to a recent fraud indictment. She and two other associates were arrested on June 18 and indicted for “conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aiding and abetting.” According to an FBI press release she and her associates oversaw a scheme by which “approximately 87 checks totaling approximately $360,000 in illegal and undisclosed kickbacks related to” Wilkey’s business and that of her associates.
