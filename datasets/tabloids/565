							Doctor, she will have it all! 68-year-old Priscilla Presley has gone OVERBOARD with the plastic surgeon’s scalpel, having had a chin implant, fillers and Botox “everywhere,” according to one astute observer!
The ex-wife of singer Elvis Presley stepped out at a theater expo at the Sheraton Hotel in Parsippany, N.J., at the weekend. 
There, she debuted a noticeably different face — all the result of dramatic plastic surgeon’s transformation over the years, according to Dr. Fred Pescatore.

“She looks like she’s had a chin implant,” Dr. Pescatore, author of The Hampton’s Diet and whom has not treated Presley, explained in an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com.
“Priscilla looks like she’s had fillers around the nose and filler in the upper lip.”
It doesn’t end there, either: The mother-of-two has had “Botox everywhere,” Dr. Pescatore added, suggesting the Naked Gun star also submitted to a “skin procedure, like Fraxel.”
Fraxel is “the original fractional laser treatment that works below the skin’s surface from the top down, addressing imperfections like fine lines, visible photo aging, wrinkles, scarring and age spots,” according to the product’s official website.

“It’s a laser procedure to the face that eliminates one layer of skin at a time,” Dr. Pescatore explained.
“Consider it a super super peel. It takes a few weeks but the skin looks amazing. It appears as if she’s had it because her skin looks really good. Honestly, she could have had better work.”
