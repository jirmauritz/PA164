 With just one word, Leah Messer’s husband Jeremy Calvert seems like he’s making a big statement. “Done,” the pipeline engineer, 25, simply tweeted this morning. Calvert, who publicly accused his former Teen Mom 2 star wife, 22, of cheating with an ex last month, posted another cryptic tweet three days prior. PHOTOS: Betrayal! Nude Photos!

Adding even more fuel to the divorce rumors, the West Virginia native— who no longer follows his wife on Twitter— has started following some interesting new ladies, including a super fan named Brittany. “I love you, you are awesome,” the blonde beauty wrote to the father of Addalyn, 21 months, on November 13. “I live in WV too not far from you. I been dying to meet you.” “I hope everything turns out great for you. You deserve to be happy and treated with respect,” she wrote a week later. “Any girl would be lucky to have you.” PHOTOS: Teen Mom Porn Star Farrah Abraham’s Sex Book Seems True To Life In addition to crushing fans, Calvert is also following stunning tattoo model Melissa Marie Hazard. ☀ divorce Exclusives Jeremy Calvery Leah Messer Teen Mom 2 Twitter if (window.innerWidth < 768 && typeof(amobee) != "undefined") { var request = new amobee.adrequest({ as: 50647, iframe: true, parameters: { acc: 104894668, lat: window.amobee_latitude, long: window.amobee_longitude }, target: document.getElementById("amobee-banner-scrolling") }); }
