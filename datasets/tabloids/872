 Whether Casper Smart had sex with a transexual model named Sofia Vissa or not, a former dance pal exclusively tells he’s not surprised by anything Jennifer Lopez‘s boy toy does and thinks “it’s all gonna come out eventually.” Joshua Lee Ayers appeared in the 2010 dance flick Step Up 3D with Smart and did several dance gigs in the past with him. “I don’t put nothing past the kid. He’s an opportunist. It’s all gonna come out eventually,” Ayers told Radar when asked his opinion on the alleged sex scandal involving the transexual woman he met on Instagram.

If a woman looks overdeveloped in more ways than one, you gotta watch out for that sketchy sh*t.” In 2012 Ayers famously accused Smart, 27, of being gay claiming he was only with Lopez, 44, for the fame — a statement he stands behind. His rep told Radar at the time, “Casper is not gay. These comments are born from envy and jealousy. It must be a slow news day.” PHOTOS: The Craziest & Most Outrageous Celebrity Rumors: What’s True, What’s Not? “He’s a little opportunist b*tch boy and he’ll do anything to help [Lopez’s] career,” Ayers told Radar. “He’ll scout other people’s talent and craft and work, then bring it to her and they’ll do a piece or a video with it. That’s what he’s always done.” Ayers claims Smart targets gay men in the dance business and flirts with them for work opportunities.

It’s really just him going that extra mile to be in the limelight,” he said. “He’s gay for opportunity, gay for the spotlight, whatever gets him in front of the camera. He’ll do it.” As Radar previously reported, a shocking post on TheDirty.com on Tuesday claims that the American Idol host’s much younger boy toy has been cheating on her with a transexual woman.
