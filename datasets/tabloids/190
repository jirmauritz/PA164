							Get ready for Team Lisa! With soap star Lisa Rinna joining Real Housewives of Beverly Hills this season, RadarOnline.com has learned that Lisa Vanderpump  has wasted no time in taking the former soap star under her wing — so she has an ally against the other cast members!
Their new alliance was front and center on Wednesday morning, when Vanderpump received a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Fame, and Rinna looked on — with her husband Harry Hamlin, Lance Bass and hunky KNBC anchor, Robert Kovacik watching as well.
With none of the other cast members in attendance — including Kyle Richards, who frequents the desert — an insider said it was an obvious sign that Vanderpump is working to get Rinna on her good side.

“Lisa Vanderpump is going out of her way to make sure that she can count on Lisa Rinna this season,” the source said. “Last year, Lisa V. was left out in the cold as all of the ladies turned on her.”
“Both of them have been social acquaintances for years, but Vanderpump is truly going the extra mile to welcome Lisa R. to the show,” the source continued.
Rinna’s decision to join the show came after she made a trial run in front of the cameras at Kyle Richards’ White Party in late June. Clearly a hit with the Bravo producers, she finally accepted the final offer soon after.

Vanderpump initially held off  on signing on for another season, but ultimately decided to give it another go after receiving a hefty pay raise.
The restaurant owner had been earning $250,000, but increased to $500,000, according to an insider.
And so far, it seems like it was a worthwhile investment.
“It’s going to be a very exciting season, and there have already been some fireworks!” the insider revealed. “There will be tons of drama that will leave viewers wanting more.”
