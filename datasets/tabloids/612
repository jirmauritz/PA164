 Kendall Jenner and Selena Gomez are on again as friends, after Gomez distanced herself following rumors Jenner had hooked up with Justin Bieber this spring. And RadarOnline.com has learned that despite the fact that Gomez now knows the fling never happened, Jenner’s closeness with Bieber is still causing issues. A source close to the 22-year-old “Come and Get It” singer tells Radar exclusively, “Despite the fact that people assume Justin and Kendall have hooked up, they have not. They are legit best friends and Selena knows this.” “Selena initially thought that they were having an affair and told Justin to stay away from her,” the insider says. “She eventually realized that was not going to happen though.” PHOTOS: Put Some Clothes On! 15 Celebs Who Have Scandalized Society With Their Naked Shenanigans In fact, Bieber is still hanging out with Keeping up with the Kardashians star, as they just celebrated mutual friend Hailey Baldwin‘s 18th birthday together, along with the 19-year-old runways model’s younger sister, Kylie Jenner.
