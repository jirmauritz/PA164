							Taking a break from her Las Vegas show, Britney Spears was photographed grabbing lunch with her kids in the Valley on Aug. 22, but her face looked noticeably different.
Top plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn exclusively tells RadarOnline.com is looks like the “Toxic” singer has used injections or fillers that left her famous face looking swollen.
“It appears that Britney said, ‘Hit Me Baby One More Time’ to her plastic surgeon!” Dr. Youn — a top plastic surgeon who has never treated Spears — told Radar.

“Her cheeks look quite plump, possibly due to injections of a filler like Voluma.”
But Dr. Youn also suggests weight gain or an allergic reaction may be to blame.
“Another possible cause could be an allergic reaction to a medication or food, or major weight gain,” he said.
“If she’s had actual filler injections, hopefully she had them recently and is still swollen. Britney usually looks really good, and as a board-certified plastic surgeon I would recommend clean living to her over any actual fillers, given as young as she is.”

And Dr. Norman Rowe agrees, suggesting the singer may have used Botox.
“It appears they Britney has had fillers placed in her cheeks to provide a lift and her forehead looks like Botox has been at work to smooth out any wrinkles,” Dr. Rowe, who has never treated Spears, told Radar.
In 2013 Spears, 32, admitted to visiting Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Raj Kanodia saying he “does fun stuff to me sometimes — I’ve had lip injections before.”
