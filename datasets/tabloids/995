 Troubled actor David Cassidy‘s divorce is turning nasty, and has exclusively learned the former Partridge Family star’s estranged wife has filed legal documents asking the court to force him to sell property they own together. Susan Cassidy filed for divorce from David in Feb. 2014 in Broward County, Fl., and then in case details obtained by Radar, she filed a Petition for Partition, which is a request for the court to sell property mutually owned since they cannot come to an agreement together.

David — who resides in Ft. Lauderdale — was driving in Los Angeles when he was pulled over for making an illegal right turn. PHOTOS: Don’t Get Mad, Get Everything!

His blood alcohol was a startling .19, more than twice the California legal limit. PHOTOS: Bikinis! The 10 Sexiest Double Divorcees! David, 64, was arrested in November, 2010 in Fla., and pleaded “no contest” to a DUI, resulting in his license being suspended for six months. In Aug., 2013, he was charged with felony drunk driving in New York. That case is still pending.
