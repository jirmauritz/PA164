							Real Housewives of Atlanta star Apollo Nida is facing one of the biggest days of his life on July 8, when he will be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud. But as he prepares for a judge to change his life forever, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that he’s doing it solo, since his wife Phaedra Parks jetted to Mexico on vacation!
Though Nida and Parks haven’t been photographed in public together for 90 days, and have kept a low profile since his legal issues began earlier this year, he tells Radar exclusively, “We’re cool. Everything’s good.”

He continued, “We’re working to make it better.”
But as he prepared for what may be his last July 4 holiday as a free man for many years, Nida revealed that his wife was miles away in Mexico.

“She’s in Mexico for someone’s birthday,” he said. “Fantasia [Barrino].”
Indeed, Parks seemed to be without a care in the world — despite her husband’s uncertain fate — as she posted happy snapshots from the trip:




Nida’s good friend, and Kandi Burrus’ husband, Todd Tucker, can be seen in some of the snaps as well.
Meanwhile, Nida was back in Atlanta planning for a special day with his son with Parks, Ayden.
“Every year I take Ayden to watch the fireworks over at Lenox Mall,” he told Radar. “There’s a hotel, and I like to get a suite to watch it outside and see it from the room, just chilling with the family.”
Will Parks make it back in time for his July 8 sentencing? Stay tuned!
