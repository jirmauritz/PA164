							It’s been less than two months since Ariana Grande and Big Sean aka Sean Anderson publicly came out as a couple but it’s getting really serious, really fast. In the latest development of their love affair, a source close to the pop-sensation tells RadarOnline.com exclusively that her mother, Joan Grande, “already treats him like her son!”
“Joan loves Sean because she knows that Ariana is safe with him,” the source tells Radar. “All she really wants for Ariana is to be with someone for the right reasons and she believes that Sean truly loves her, so Joan loves him.”
On Nov. 29, the 21-year-old “Problem” singer shared a photo on her Instagram of several-dozen pink roses, which were from the 26-year-old rapper, who was previously engaged to actress Naya Rivera, 27.

As Radar previously reported, they are spending their “first holiday together as a couple” and, according to the source, “Ariana feels that he is her soul partner.”
