 Tamra Barney is locked in an EPIC custody battle with her ex-husband Simon Barney, who has accused the Real Housewives of Orange County star of neglecting their young children. But is there a domestic violence secret behind the pair’s drawn-out, knock ‘em dead court fight? A new report claims Simon was arrested for domestic violence almost 10 years ago after an incident which left Bravolebrity Tamra with injuries so extensive that she “had black eyes and a busted lip.” As previously reported, the Real Housewives of Orange County  star’s husband was arrested in 2010 on domestic violence charges. This apparently wasn’t Simon’s first brush with the law, however: As Radar previously reported, Tamra’s eldest son Ryan Vieth recently wrote about an incident on his Facebook page.

According to a new report on blog All Things Real Housewives, Tamra was left bloodied and bruised after allegedly being assaulted. “She was hit so hard that she had black eyes and a busted lip,” a source told the website.
