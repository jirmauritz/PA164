							Remember Chet Cannon?
He starred on MTV’s Real World: Brooklyn during their 21st season in 2009 and made a splash as a “hipster Mormon” — and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned he got married today in a secret ceremony  in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we have all the photos and video.
In April Cannon announced on Twitter that he was engaged to Danielle Paxton by posting a photo of the two on his Instagram account with the caption:
“I’m getting married to this beautiful girl!”

“Chet and Danielle got married at the Salt Lake City Mormon Temple around noon today,” an eyewitness told Radar of the Aug. 15 nuptials.
“It was a small private event, primarily family with around maybe 50 people.”
Cannon was known on the MTV reality show for abstaining from both alcohol and premarital sex, and comes from a family of 10 kids.
“Aside from the fact that he just got married, the big talk at the wedding was that Chet is supposedly working on producing a kids show,” the source added.

“But it’s all being kept very hush-hush right for now.”
Congrats to the happy couple!
