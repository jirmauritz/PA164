At 11 a.m., when the doors opened at [her restaurant] Lady & Sons, she stood in front and rang an iron dinner bell.” Jones was also tasked with making hoecakes at an open kitchen station in view of customers, and according to the paper, “Deen wanted Jones to dress in an old-style Aunt Jemima outfit.” While Deen denied the accusation, former employee Dora Charles said, “Jellyroll didn’t want to hear that. She didn’t want to do that.” PHOTOS: It’s 5 O’Clock Somewhere!
