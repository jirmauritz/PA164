 Kourtney Kardashian celebrated her second baby shower on Sunday with a “pajama party” theme at IHOP in Calabasas, Calif., and although the reality star had all of her BFFs there, something was noticeably missing – her family! “They were not there for a reason,” a family insider tells RadarOnline.com exclusively. According to the source, the reason for Kim, Khloe, and Kris Jenner’s absence is that “Kourtney has been distancing herself from her family as much as possible, and just focusing on her baby on the way.” PHOTOS: The Men Accused Of Being Khloe Kardashian’s Real Father When deciding who would make the cut for the small affair, the source says, “Kourtney wanted to keep it intimate. All of the girls there have been BFFs with her since they were little.” “The baby shower on Wednesday was the ‘Kim show’ and Kourtney can’t deal,” the source tells Radar, referring to the family-oriented celebration held earlier in the week with sisters Kim, Khloe and Kylie at Beverly Hills, Calif.’s Montage hotel.

This will be the third child for the 35-year-old mother of two previous children –Mason, 4, and Penelope, 2 – with longtime boyfriend Scott Disick.
