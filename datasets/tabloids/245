							While Kate Gosselin has been quoted as saying the film crew on Jon & Kate Plus 8 was “like family,” she certainly didn’t treat them as such, author Robert Hoffman claims in his tell-all expose on the reality TV queen.
“They’re like a part of us,” Gosselin said of the crew members during an appearance on The Talk in 2011.
But Hoffman paints a very different picture in Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled The World where he published a copy of the “House Rules” he claims Gosselin handed out to crew members while filming Jon & Kate Plus 8.
