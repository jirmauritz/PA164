“Courtland’s felony charge relates back to his April 2013 arrest for possession of heroin with Jenelle,” a source told Radar.
“And the misdemeanor charge is because he didn’t show up in court on Tuesday for the case about Jenelle’s sister Ashleigh.”
Rogers is being held on $150,000 bond for the felony charge and $5,000 for the misdemeanor charge.
