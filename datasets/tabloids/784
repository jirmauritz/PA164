							Kendall Jenner is fed up with her mother Kris Jenner’s controlling ways and is no longer “keeping up” the façade. RadarOnline.com has learned that she’s dumping the family momager to hire a professional management team!
“Kendall has made it very clear to Kris that she is no longer managing her career,” a source close to the family tells Radar exclusively. “Kris is aware of this … Kendall has moved out and moved on months ago.”
“She sees straight through all of her mom’s BS and she will not let Kris exploit her like Kris did Kim,” the insider adds, referring to Jenner’s 34-year-old half-sister, sex tape star Kim Kardashian.

According to the source, the stunning 19-year-old runway model “has been shopping around for her own team, not affiliated with the Keeping up with the Kardashians brand at all. That includes a new manager, rep and agent of her own.”
As Radar previously reported, 59-year-old momager Kris has gotten a lot of heat for promoting Kendall’s Love magazine online Advent calendar, which featured a video of Kendall as Day 8.
“These photos were tame compared to what Kim has done and everyone is making a big deal out of nothing,” the source tells Radar.

“She did not ask Kris to promote this in any way,” the insider says. “Kris has been investing a lot of time in Kendall and Kendall does not invest any time in Kris. She’s done.”
Kendall isn’t the first family member to jump ship: Last fall, Kim hired high-power rep Ina Treciokas to oversee her publicity.
