Before leaving The View in 2007 she’d helped raise viewership on the show a lot, in just one season. The network is hopeful she could do the same again.” O’Donnell returned to the talk show in Feb. as a guest host, but network executives are hoping it will become something more permanent.

She’s comfortable on TV and in all her glory when she gets to express her personal views on current events and talking points,” the source added. “Any controversy that surrounds Rosie is good for ratings. So it’s a win-win.” ABC execs have publicly remained mum with no confirmations of who will make up the new panel for Season 18.
