							Lance Bass wed his longtime boyfriend Michael Turchin just a few weeks ago, but they are already started on bigger plans for 2015: Insiders tell RadarOnline.com the couple are going to jump right into starting a family!
“Lance and Michael are going to use a surrogate and also adoption as a means to have children together,” the insider tells Radar. “They eventually want to have two to three kids and they have already started the process.”
Bass, 35, and his new husband, who have been together since 2010, wed on Dec. 20 at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles surrounded by friends and family — including JC Chasez, 38, Joey Fatone, 37, and Chris Kirkpatrick, 43, from ‘NSync.
According to the source, “They do not think that being married is any different for them than it was before. They are just glad that they finally have a ring on it.”

“Lance is obviously the main bread-winner in the family and although he tells Michael that he just wants him to be happy and concentrate on his art, sometimes Michael feels like he does not contribute enough financially,” the source admits.
“But overall, they are very much in love, happily married and looking forward to starting a family together.”
