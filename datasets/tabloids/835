 Kelly Clarkson is due to have her first child in just weeks and has exclusively learned that despite allegations of her husband cheating on her, the “Since U Been Gone” singer is happier than ever prepping for parenthood. Clarkson, 32, and Brandon Blackstock have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of their daughter and have put all the finishing touches on their Nashville, Tenn., nursery, a source tells Radar. “They are beyond excited over this baby. Kelly is just busting with joy and can’t wait to hold her,” the insider said. “They’ve got the nursery all together and now it’s just a waiting game.” Last Dec. Clarkson’s newlywed bliss was cracked when an anonymous woman claimed to have had an affair with Blackstock. “We haven’t slept together,” the unidentified woman claimed, “but we’ve been intimate in other ways. I really hope his wife keeps her eye on him because he’s not the great man she thinks he is.” Clarkson was quick to laugh off the reports while Blackstock responded on Twitter by also using humor. Love hanging with my pregnant wife!!! Can't wait to meet my baby girl!!! — Brandon Blackstock (@BBlackstock) February 27, 2014 “Kelly never really doubted Brandon and all she’s ever wanted is a baby,” the insider told Radar. “So they’re just focused on their family right now. Of course the report disappeared, because it wasn’t true.” As Radar previously reported, Clarkson is due June 18 and if you want to take a peek at their baby registry, click here!
