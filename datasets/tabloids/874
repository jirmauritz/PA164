 Kevin Hart is quite the comedian, but he pulled out all the stops when it came to his elaborate engagement on Monday night to his girlfriend of five years, Eniko Parrish — and RadarOnline.com has all the exclusive details. Parish, an aspiring model and actress from Baltimore, thought that she was going to Yebo Restaurant in Atlanta to celebrate her 30th birthday party, but was completely swept off her feet by Hart. Justin Anthony, owner of Yebo, tells RadarOnline.com exclusively, “Kevin has been planning this for some time now. He got together with us to plan an elaborate engagement that was masked as a surprise birthday party.” Photos: Inside Kevin Hart’s Engagement “Eniko thought that she was coming here for a surprise birthday party with 10 close friends. She had no idea what was in store,” Anthony continued. “We cleared out the entire restaurant. We had a harp player, we had ice sculptures and there were images of her from her childhood until now everywhere around the restaurant.” But that wasn’t the end of it — the guest list, which included Ludacris, was all told to keep everything as a surprise for Parish.

People were crying. It was very, very romantic.” As for Parish’s response, Hart announced the news on Instagram, posting a photo of the two of them along with the caption, “She said YEEEEESSSSS…… #Happy #MyRib #iF—kingLoveHer.” This will be the second marriage for Hart, who has two children, Heavenly and Hendricks with ex-wife Torrei Hart.   Guests dined on a special menu created specifically for the event, which included Ahi Tuna, Shrimp and Avocado Stacks, Salmon Filet, Lollipop Lamb and Fried Chicken.
