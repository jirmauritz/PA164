 Jennifer Lopez and ex-boyfriend Casper Smart made a surprising appearance when they were photographed together on Monday, but has exclusively learned it has nothing to do with the two of them  — it’s for the kids. In fact, a source tells Radar the only reason the couple stayed in a relationship as long as they did in the first place was for the sake of her children. “They wanted it to end for quite a while, but the only reason Casper stayed was for those kids because he loves them so much,” an insider told Radar.
