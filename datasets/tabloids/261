 Teen Mom 2 star Adam Lind is not exactly known for living on the straight and narrow. Chelsea Houska‘s baby daddy has been convicted of DUI three times, and now that he’s split up with his pregnant girlfriend, Taylor Halbur, the controversial reality star has resorted to shady measures to get a bachelor body: A friend of Lind’s tells Radar exclusively, he’s been using steroids! “Adam takes a pill form of steroids,” the source claimed. “It’s not prescribed or anything.” The pal identified the steroid as Dbol (Dianabol or Methandrostenolone), an anabolic steroid that is a controlled substance in the United States, but can be obtained without prescription in Mexico. Insiders say that Lind has been desperately trying to change his body over the past few months, and has been documenting his progress with a flurry of shameless selfies of himself at the gym and shirtless on Instagram.

In fact, the source thinks that Lind is just posting the pictures as a desperate attempt to get some attention. “Adam just loves the attention, so that’s why he posted the pictures on Instagram,” the pal said. “I can’t tell if he’s really cocky and thinks he looks great or if he actually feels like he needs the ego boost, but he obviously likes the attention.” PHOTOS: Terrible Teens: Too Sexy, Too Soon? “I give him props for going to the gym, but usually you don’t spend your time taking pictures while you’re there,” the source added. “He just wants to make sure everyone knows that he is there.” So what does Lind’s ex Houska think about his new body? “Chelsea thinks it’s funny that he posted the pictures,” a friend of Chelsea’s told Radar. “Chelsea doesn’t find him attractive at all.” PHOTOS: The 10 Most Scandalous Teen Moms!
