 Teen Mom 2 star Leah Messer proudly showed off a photo of her adorable family over the weekend with her twin daughter Ali smiling in her wheelchair but has exclusively learned that she and her ex aren’t always on the same page when it comes to their child’s diagnosis and that he “doesn’t want to accept” she needs the chair. The MTV star, 21, has been openly sharing the struggles she faces as a mother with a child diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy and shared a picture of her three daughters together, writing: “Just a day at the aquarium with my babies! It was PERFECT!” and Ali looked cheerful in the shot. However, Corey Simms, the father of twins Ali and Aleeah “Gracie,” has been reluctant to accept the fact that his daughter needs the wheelchair.

He doesn’t want to accept that she does need the wheelchair.” PHOTOS: The 10 Most Scandalous Teen Moms!
