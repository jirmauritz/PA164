 Lupita Nyong’o has been named PEOPLE’s Most Beautiful woman of the year — a coveted honor, unless the 12 Years A Slave star’s skin was digitally altered? One expert has told that he believes the famed magazine used creative lighting to brighten the breakout actress’ skin tone and make her look lighter. “This is though a classic example of a ‘well lit photo’ versus a photo with poor lighting,” Giles Fabris, the Chief Executive Officer & Director of Operations for LookBetterOnline.com, told in an exclusive interview. “She looks washed out in the PEOPLE magazine photo.” PHOTOS: Lupita Nyong’o PEOPLE Cover — You Be The Judge This is not the first time a magazine has been accused of such trickery: In January, Vanity Fair was slammed online from readers who said Nyong’o’s dark skin looked noticeably lighter. The Kenyan born star, 31, took home the Oscar for her role in 12 Years a Slave and remains the toast of Tinseltown, earning praise for her performance and fashion forward red carpet choices throughout awards season. Further adding weight to the claims about PEOPLE, Nyong’o appears different from her natural look and other appearance on covers, like this one — Dazed and Confused, where she appeared in February.
