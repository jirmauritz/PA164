 Nick Cannon’s father James Cannon posted a series of very cryptic messages this past week seemingly bashing his soon to be ex-daughter-in-law. But has learned that he is not the only Cannon family member that is not a fan of Mariah Carey! “Nick’s whole family urged him to leave Mariah because she made him a miserable person towards the end,” a source close to Cannon clan tells Radar exclusively. “They never really got close to Mariah because she made zero effort. But they were accepting of her as long as Nick was happy,” the source says.

The source says it doesn’t look likely! “Nick and the family will always be there for her and for the kids, but he is done,” the family insider adds.
