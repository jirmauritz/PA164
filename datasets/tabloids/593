 Convicted tax cheat Wesley Snipes  was all smiles on the red carpet promoting The Expendables 3 last week in Hollywood. But on the way to the after-party, that smile faded when the former jailbird was served with a notice ordering him to appear for a debtor’s examination — and has exclusively obtained the embarrassing photo! Snipes is being sued by famed public relations powerhouse firm Sitrick & Company for failure to pay fees associated with work the group did when the actor was facing felony tax evasion charges. READ: Court Documents Sitrick & Co. filed a lawsuit against the actor , and was granted a judgment, which has now ballooned to more than $103,000. According to court documents, Snipes must “furnish information to aid in enforcement of a money judgement.” The document clearly states he “may be subject to arrest and punishment for contempt of court, and the court may take an order requiring [him] to pay reasonable attorney fees incurred by the judgment creditor in this proceeding.” PHOTOS: Wesley Snipes Over The Years In 2008, Snipes was convicted of three misdemeanor counts of failure to file tax returns for three years, and cheating the government out of $7 million. After losing an appeal in 2010, Snipes was sentenced to three years in prison, and was released from a correctional facility in 2013, after serving three years. Sources familiar with the situation tell Radar, “Wesley never contested any of the bills of fees of Sitrick & Co.” PHOTOS: Wesley Snipes’ Jail Cell Attempts to reach Snipes for comment were unsuccessful, and Sitrick & Co didn’t immediately respond.
