							Kim Kardashian is in the midst of planning her upcoming wedding — or rather, weddings! — but should she be keeping a closer eye on her man? Just weeks after RadarOnline.com revealed how her fiancé Kanye West’s relationship with his protegee, Pia Mia, was raising eyebrows, the sexy singer bragged on Instagram about being the “other woman!”
Pia Mia, born Pia Ajdba Mia Perez, wrote on her Instagram on April 24 that the trailer for the upcoming movie The Other Woman was the “story of my life … #OtherWoman,” she wrote in a paid post for the movie starring Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton.
And her fans were quick to call her out for apparently stirring up drama with Kardashian, 33.

And @avavavavava added, “Wtf Pia Mia you sneaky b***h.”
As Radar has reported, the seventeen-year-old’s relationship with West, 36, has raised eyebrows in recent weeks.

“Kanye is producing some tracks for her and he’s quite involved,” a source in his camp told Radar exclusively. “He believes she could be the next Rihanna.” 
“Kanye has made it clear to everyone that their relationship is strictly creative,” the insider said. But as they’ve grown closer, and the teen has become one of his trusted advisors, their relationship has raised eyebrows.
 “Kanye’s creative team was pretty shocked that he would use a teenager as his confidante [on his line with APC],” the insider said. “And Kim was actually kind of agitated by it, because he doesn’t usually want her input on design stuff. She was a little jealous.”
