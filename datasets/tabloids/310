 Nick Cannon may be trying to save face now that he let it spill that he and Mariah Carey are living separate lives. But he wasn’t fooling anyone on the set of his hit show Wild ‘N Out. “Their separation wasn’t a surprise. People knew it was coming. It was just a matter of time,” an on-set source told Radar. The telltale sign: The Grammy-winner’s noticeable absence on the MTV set. “During the first season Mariah made an appearance. But this season she didn’t come to the set at all,” the insider added. “She was working on her own stuff and Nick just did his stuff.” PHOTOS: Don’t Get Mad, Get Everything!

Despite reports that Cannon strayed with a co-star, the America’s Got Talent host didn’t give away to those working with him that there was any domestic discord or infidelity.

And he didn’t show any ‘trouble in paradise’ on set,” said our source. “When he was on the road he was cool, but he would go his separate ways and the girls would go their separate ways.”
