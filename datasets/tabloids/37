 Long Island Medium Theresa Caputo has come under fire from former guests, clients, investigators and now members of her own profession are weighing in on her scandal with one psychic saying that if she is not being truthful about learning information prior to reading people that may be “bordering on criminal.” The Outer Limits Of Inner Truth (www.outerlimitsradio.com) Radio Show spoke with two psychic mediums and one past life reader who shared their own opinions about the beleaguered TLC reality star and has the exclusive audio of their characterizations of Caputo. As previously reported, one client of Caputo’s claimed that she suspected the Long Island Medium could have been given information about her personal life before actually meeting her.

The reason I do not believe that is happening is her reputation to this point has been pretty darn good I would say. Psychic medium Kerrie O’Connor (www.kerrieoconnor.com) told The Outer Limits of Inner Truth that she believes Caputo is now playing to her audience. “She knows what the public wants and is pumped up from it. Part of her knows consciously that she is pushing the envelope with not being totally ethical with it. Especially if she has to save face.

The more she gets pulled into the Hollywood version of it the more she’s not taping into her gift.” PHOTOS: Faked Scenes, Lies & Payoffs!
