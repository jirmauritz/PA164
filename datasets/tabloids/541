							After a lifetime of addiction, actor Robin Williams was valiantly battling his demons even in the months before his death. RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that before entering rehab this summer, the actor was spotted at a San Francisco AA meeting earlier this year.

Williams was photographed looking grim and focused at a San Francisco AA meeting earlier this year:

Williams opened up about his experiences in Alcoholics Anonymous during a 2013 interview.
“I felt so good about the first AA meeting that I attended that I went out and drank the next day,” he said. “And then I felt so bad that I came to the [next] meeting and said, ‘I screwed up. I can’t come back.’ A friend said, ‘Why not?’ I went, ‘I drank after the meeting.’ And he said, ‘Hey, we don’t shoot our wounded. Come back.’”

Williams went sober cold turkey in the 80s after battling alcohol and cocaine abuse. After roughly twenty years sober, he relapsed and entered rehab in 2006. Most recently, he entered rehab again this summer, at The Lodge at Hazelden Addiction Treatment Center in Minnesota, but reps said at the time it was only to “fine-tune” his ongoing “commitment” to his sobriety.
As Radar reported, he was found dead of an apparent suicide on Monday afternoon at his Tiburon, California home.
