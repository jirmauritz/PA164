 Dr. Terry Dubrow admits he does fight with his Real Housewives of Orange County star wife, Heather— but swears his marriage is intact. “If there isn’t some bickering in a marriage, [the couple] is either not paying attention to each other or lying about it,” the renowned Newport Beach, California plastic surgeon, currently starring on new E! reality series “Botched,” tells RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview. The father of four also suggests that editing on the Bravo show may paint a more dramatic picture of his union.

She does show up to my office to say hi and give me a little kiss, but she never accompanies me in a clinical setting with my patients.” PHOTOS: 18 Extreme Real Life Plastic Surgery Disasters Heather, however, “is very supportive of the show,” he gushes. “She’s super organized and super smart. She has to hold all these balls in the air. Sometimes if I’m silly, she feels one of the balls may drop!” Terry admits that sometimes his “silly nature” clashes with her more “focused” demeanor.

I had kids when I was a little bit older, so I’m half-way between a dad and grandpa. Grandparents are silly and easy-going,” the 55-year-old explains. To avoid fights, “I try not to have the first thing out of my mouth be a joke when Heather is talking about certain subjects!” To see Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif act silly and perform extraordinarily challenging surgeries, watch the Botched premiere on Tuesday, June 24 at 9 pm ET on E!.
