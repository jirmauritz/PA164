 Lady Gaga is embroiled in a legal battle with another artist who claims the pop star stole her music for the hit song “Judas” and RadarOnline.com has exclusively obtained the federal court appeal. Singer Rebecca Francescatti sued Gaga, claiming she stole her 1999 track “Juda” and turned it into the 2011 knockoff, “Judas” — stating the songs are nearly identical. EXCLUSIVE COURT DOCUMENTS: Lady Gaga Slapped With Federal Court Appeal Over ‘Judas’ Hit Gaga has vehemently denied stealing the song and says she took nothing from Francescatti. “Defendants had access to and actually copied the protectable expression embodied in Francescatti’s song,” the new June 30 filing claims. “Gaga’s song sounds substantially similar to Francescatti’s… Francescatti contends that Gaga’s song ‘Judas’ infringes upon Francescatti’s copyright in her song ‘Juda.'” The battle between Gaga and Francescatti has waged on for more than a year, but the Federal Court ruled in Gaga’s favor last month determining that the two songs are not substantially similar and that there was “not sufficient to give rise to a finding that the Gaga song has captured the total concept and feel of the Francescatti song.” PHOTOS: You Can Sue For That?
