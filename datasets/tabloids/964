							Former Teen Mom star Amber Portwood has turned her troubled life around and now wants to help mentor other teens to do the same — but Canadian pop star Justin Bieber might be a lost cause!
Having had kicked her addictions and wild behavior while serving 17 months in an Indiana prison, Portwood taped a segment on The Maury Show in which she tried to talk some sense into teenage girls taking a toxic path in life, and only RadarOnline.com has the exclusive sneak peek.
“We got young people in Hollywood who are acting a lot like these kids. What do you think of Justin Bieber?” Maury Povich asked Portwood, 24.

“He wants attention. The thing about…I remember being a teenager. I wanted attention, I wasn’t getting it, so I did crazy stuff. Exactly what you guys are doing,” the mother of one admitted.
“And that’s what it is. It’s about publicity and it’s about money. That’s all it is.”

“Amber was a fantastic mentor for the teen guests that appeared on the show,” an insider told Radar.
As Radar previously reported, Portwood exclusively told Radar while still locked up — a consequence of a 5-year sentence for failing to complete a drug rehab program, which was required from earlier arrests for drug possession and parole violations — that she was “working my a** off to get out” and even got her GED.

Since being released from prison, Portwood has remained relatively private, except for a Twitter fight with Teen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans.
It all started after Portwood gave an interview where she said Evans belonged behind bars and that getting pregnant for a second time was irresponsible.
