							Teresa Giudice celebrated her daughter Milania’s First Communion in true Jersey style – with an “over the top” party that an insider told RadarOnline.com exclusively was “a blowout affair,” for the legally challenged family.
The Real Housewives of New Jersey star was one proud mama at her daughter’s Catholic ceremony, but our spy said the threat of their looming jail sentences seemed far from the minds of the reality stars.
“Teresa and Joe put on a great game face,” the source told Radar.
“You never would have known that they’re about to be sentenced for their felony charges.  And you really wouldn’t have known from the party.”

Sparing no expense for the daughter’s ceremony, the source said the party was just like any other Giudice affair.
“It was really over the top and it seems like Teresa got a lot of the stuff donated.  It was a blowout affair. She and Joe are not used to watching their money and this showed that they haven’t learned anything.”
However, there was family harmony at the event, with Melissa and Joe Gorga and their three children attending the party.

“There was no drama between Melissa and Teresa. It’s all about putting family first right now,” another source told Radar about the former feuding family members.
Little Milania, dressed like a princess bride in a custom designed gown from Little Nicki’s, where her cousin Antonia Gorga is the “model” for their communion gowns, was the belle of the ball.
“Miliana looked beautiful and loved being the center of attention,” the source told Radar.
