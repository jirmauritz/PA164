 Despite drowning in $13.5 million in debt before filing for bankruptcy, and thousands in restitution for her fraud case looming, has learned that Teresa Giudice recently forked out five figures for her daughter, Gia‘s music video — against her husband Joe‘s orders. Gia, 13, recently shot the video covering Britney Spears’ song “Circus” with her all-girl band, 3KT, which also includes Alex Maetta, 16, and Cristianna Cardinale, 14. The production was in direct defiance of Gia’s dad, who is trying to be fiscally responsible, according to a source. “Teresa didn’t care and spent $10,000 for it,” an insider tells Radar exclusively. “The money Teresa paid only covered a fraction of the costs for the video. It was a very expensive to shoot, and the other girls’ families also contributed.” PHOTOS: Real Housewives, Real Scandals: 28 Of The Biggest Scandals To Hit The Bravo Franchise “Now Joe is absolutely furious with Teresa for defying him, especially since they really need to be on a strict budget,” another insider tells. “They owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, restitution, and of course millions in the bankruptcy case,” IT'S HERE!!
