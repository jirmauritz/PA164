 They made it! Provided Kim Kardashian doesn’t file for divorce today, her marriage to rapper Kanye West has lasted a full 72 days and despite the reportedly rocky union they will easily surpass her last marriage to Kris Humphries.

Kardashian and West said “I do” on May 24 at the 16th century Fort Belvedere in Florence, Italy in front of 600 guests after a lavish Palace of Versailles pre-wedding party the night before. But the couple has quickly come under fire since they’ve rarely been spotted together following their nuptials 72 days ago. PHOTOS: Seeing Double!

West is Kardashian’s third marriage — her first was to music producer Damon Thomas and ended in 2004. How long do you think Kim and Kanye will last? Sound off in the comments below…
