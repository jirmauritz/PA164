 Amanda Bynes‘ DUI arrest on Sunday was a shocking sign that the troubled actress is headed down a dark path yet again. But has learned that her life could be about to get a lot worse: Insiders tell that the incident could be ruled a violation of her current probation, and she could be sent to jail for a year! According to the CHP, Bynes’ car was found stopped in the middle of an intersection in Sherman Oaks. After performing several field sobriety tests, which she was unable to execute, Bynes was arrested and taken to the police station to be booked. Bynes did consent to a blood test, which will reveal what drugs, if any, were present at the time of the arrest. It’s the latest setback for Bynes, who had been placed on a three-year probation in February connected to a 2012 DUI arrest.

Amanda is a danger to others and needs to go back to treatment. “Her arrest on Sunday morning could send her to jail for up to a year,” the source added. The recent  termination of her conservatorship could have precipitated her latest fall off the wagon.

The conservatorship simply expired, and Amanda’s mom, Lynn, made no effort to extend it. Bynes’ mother Lynn was granted conservatorship of her troubled daughter after a parade of erratic and bizarre incidents, culminating in her hospitalization after setting a small fire in a neighbor’s driveway.
