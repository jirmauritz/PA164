 Embroiled in a heated copyright lawsuit over his hit “Big Pimpin’,” Jay Z is now refusing to sit down and answer questions about the allegations, so RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned the man suing him is asking the judge to order that the rapper be deposed. Originally filed in 2011, Osama Ahmed Fahmy — heir to a 1960s composer named Baligh Hamdy who created the musical composition “Khosara, Khosara” — filed a lawsuit claiming he licensed his fathers song, and claims Jay Z violated that by sampling it with his 2000 collaboration with UGK, “Big Pimpin’.” EXCLUSIVE COURT DOCUMENTS: Jay Z Refuses Deposition In ‘Big Pimpin’ Lawsuit In court documents filed on June 10, Fahmy urged the court to force Jay Z — real name Shawn Carter — and Timbaland to give depositions. Jay Z and his label argued they had obtained the proper license and did nothing wrong, and on June 25 Fahmy filed documents obtained by Radar in which he again asked the court to order Jay and Timbaland to take depositions.

In a copyright case, such as this, a defendant is required, as a matter of course, to disclose information regarding its revenue related to the infringing work.” PHOTOS: Beyonce Through The Years Neither of the rappers have responded to the request for a deposition and provided no dates when they were able to sit down for the questioning. Fahmy argues that Jay Z continues to collect royalties on the song despite the allegation that he doesn’t have a valid license. The court has yet to make a decision.
