 On the one-year anniversary of Paul Walker’s death in a fiery car crash, the Los Angeles office of his manager and friend Matt Luber was robbed of “countless voicemail messages, videos, private files, personal emails [and] photos” linked to the late actor, a source told exclusively. On Nov. 30, a source said two women were caught on security camera breaking into the offices of Luber Roklin Entertainment and stealing 18 Mac computers and printers valued at over $20,000, the insider claims. According to the source, Luber “was Paul’s manager and close friend for decades and he is absolutely devastated — not only did the computers have his entire life on there but, more importantly, all of the files on Walker’s life and death.” PHOTOS: What Happened Here?
