 Another year older and a new boyfriend. As Sofia Vergara rang in her 42nd birthday on Thursday night surrounded by family and friends, has exclusively learned she also brought along the new man in her life, True Blood hunk Joe Manganiello. Following a breakup with former fiancé Nick Loeb, reports quickly surfaced that the Modern Family star had moved on with Manganiello, 37, and it certainly seemed that way at her birthday party.

As Radar previously reported, the 6’5″ actor has allegedly been “smitten with her for years” and grabbed the opportunity to make an impression when the they met for the first time at the White House Correspondents Dinner in May.
