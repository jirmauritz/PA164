							Severe migraines and an ulcer brought Tori Spelling to the hospital last week, sources exclusively tell RadarOnline.com.
“Tori’s head hurt so much, she couldn’t have any light in her bedroom,” a family insider recalls. “And she couldn’t keep any food down from the ulcer. She was in a great deal of pain and was very scared.”
Friends say extreme stress from husband Dean McDermott’s December fling with a Toronto woman led to the reality star’s physical decline.

“She was just so run-down and ragged from the affair fallout,” the insider explains.
Not surprisingly, the former Beverly Hills, 90210 actress’ health crisis will be chronicled on her new Lifetime reality show, True Tori.
“For Tori, nothing is off-limits to the cameras,” the source says. “But production was not allowed to follow Tori into the hospital. She needed peace and quiet with no pressure.”

According to E!, the mother of four, 40, was spotted leaving an L.A.-area hospital on April 26 with a pink medical band on her wrist.
Husband McDermott, 47, stayed by the star’s side every day of her at least six-day stint, the site adds.
Spelling has been a frequent hospital patient over the past few years: In 2012, she was treated for severe pregnancy complications while expecting youngest child Finn, now 20 months. She was ordered to hospital bed rest for nearly two months.
