 Honey Boo Boo and her infamous crew of country characters are the small town family who made it big. But the unique Thompson clan, who brought fans such unforgettable catch phrases as ‘redneckonize’, ‘vajiggle jaggle’ and ‘go-go-juice’, are splitting up, now that matriarch and patriarch June Shannon and Mike “Sugar Bear” Thompson have called it quits. And like many obscure families thrust into the reality TV spotlight, their neighbors tell RadarOnline.com that the price of fame could have broken up their happy home. Doris Phillips, who used to take Shannon’s girls to Sunday school, says her small town Georgia community didn’t even know the couple had called things off. “They don’t’ socialize much with the community anymore. When they got famous they didn’t have much communication with us,” Phillips told RadarOnline.com exclusively. “But they’ve always been so nice. I don’t know them having problems with anyone around town.” PHOTOS: TV’s FAKEST Family: 25 Times The Kardashians Have Secretly Deceived, Duped & Outright LIED To Fans Even in McIntyre – population 650 – the latest break-up news was news to the locals. “I didn’t know anything about them splitting up.
